# Request Logger

This plug logs detailed information about every HTTP request to the application.

## What Gets Logged

For every request, the following information is logged:

- **Method**: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- **Path**: Request path (e.g., `/terms/new`)
- **User-Agent**: Browser/client information
- **IP Address**: Client IP address (handles X-Forwarded-For header for proxied requests)
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for the request (generated by Plug.RequestId)
- **Query String**: URL query parameters

## Example Log Output

```
Request Info:
  Method: GET
  Path: /definition/test
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)
  IP Address: 127.0.0.1
  Request ID: F8qZ3mK9xXvQAAAAAAB
  Query String: 
```

## Implementation

The plug is located at `lib/wortwildnis_web/plugs/request_logger.ex` and is added to the endpoint pipeline after `Plug.RequestId` and `Plug.Telemetry`.

## Configuration

Logs are output at the `:info` level. In production, you can control whether these logs appear by adjusting the logger configuration in `config/prod.exs`.

To disable request logging in production, you can either:

1. Set logger level to `:warning` or higher
2. Remove the plug from `lib/wortwildnis_web/endpoint.ex`

## Privacy Considerations

Note that user-agent strings and IP addresses may contain personally identifiable information. Ensure your logging practices comply with applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).
